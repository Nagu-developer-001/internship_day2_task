            <!-- UPDATED INTRO -->
            <p>
                Hello! I am a passionate full-stack web development learner who enjoys
                building real-world applications and understanding how systems work
                behind the scenes.
            </p>

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <!-- UPDATED JOURNEY -->
            <p>
                I started my coding journey with HTML and CSS, gradually moving into
                JavaScript and full-stack development using the MERN stack. Over time,
                I developed a strong interest in real-time technologies and system behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have built projects such as a real-time chat application, a video
                conferencing system (in progress), and a full-stack travel booking
                platform. I also published an npm package to promote code reusability
                and better development practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Passion & Goals</h3>
            <!-- UPDATED GOALS -->
            <p>
                I am passionate about problem-solving, Data Structures & Algorithms,
                and building scalable applications. Alongside development, I actively
                share knowledge by running a LinkedIn community called <strong>AlgoHub</strong>,
                where I simplify DSA concepts for beginners.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer, contribute to open-source
                projects, and work on impactful software through internships and
                collaborative development opportunities.
